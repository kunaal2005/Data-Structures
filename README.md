**Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Journey**

Welcome to my personal repository for learning and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms. This project serves as a log of my progress and a collection of my solutions to various problems.

**ðŸŽ¯ About This Repository**
This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Here, you will find my implementations of various data structures and solutions to common algorithmic problems, primarily coded in C++. The main goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA concepts, one step at a time.

**ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure**
The repository is organized by data structure or concept. Each folder contains the source code, and where applicable, a README.md file with explanations or problem links.

ðŸš€ What's Inside?
Here is a list of the topics I am covering. I will be checking them off as I complete them.

Data Structures
[ ] Arrays & Strings

[ ] Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

[ ] Stacks

[ ] Queues

[ ] Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)

[x] Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)

[ ] Tries

[ ] Graphs

[ ] Hash Tables

Algorithms
[ ] Searching (Linear, Binary)

[ ] Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)

[ ] Recursion & Backtracking

[ ] Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)

[ ] Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)

[ ] Dynamic Programming

**ðŸ’» How to Use**
Feel free to browse the code. If you are also on a learning journey, you can use my solutions for reference. To compile and run any of the C++ files, you'll need a C++ compiler like g++.

# Example of compiling and running a file
g++ -o output_file YourSourceFile.cpp
./output_file
